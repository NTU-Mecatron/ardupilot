# Ardupilot fork by Mecatron

This fork contains custom frame configs stored at [AP_Motors6DOF](libraries/AP_Motors/AP_Motors6DOF.cpp) for Mecatron use.

It also contains guide for running ArduSub SITL (Software In The Loop) so that you can run pixhawk package without the need of a physical pixhawk.
However, if you do not intend to run SITL (simulation), ignore all SITL related commands and just follow the firmware build and upload guide.

## Installation

```bash
cd ~/
git clone --recursive -b Sub-4.5 https://github.com/NTU-Mecatron/ardupilot.git
cd ardupilot
```

## Setup for the first time build

For first time setup on Jetson, you may need to enable Docker access for your user:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

> Note: You may need to restart Jetson for the changes to take effect.

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --rm -t ardupilot-dev .
```

After that, run **either** of the following commands to configure the build:
**

```bash
# If you are configuring on your own computer for SITL
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/ardupilot ardupilot-dev ./waf configure --board=sitl

# If you are working with a physical Pixhawk 6C (for example, to upload firmware)
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/ardupilot ardupilot-dev ./waf configure --board=Pixhawk6C
```

## Subsequent builds

Whenever you make changes to the code, you only need to run the following command to build the firmware (if you already followed the setup above):

```bash
# The above command is only for configuring the build
# You need to run this command to actually build it
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/ardupilot ardupilot-dev ./waf sub
```

## Uploading firmware

To upload the firmware to the Pixhawk 6C (which is usually at port `/dev/ttyACM0` and `/dev/ttyACM1`), run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged -v $PWD:/ardupilot ardupilot-dev ./waf --upload-port="/dev/ttyACM0" --upload sub
```

## Uploading parameters

We have created a parameter file [pix6c.parm](pix6c.parm) for custom use at Mecatron. This parameter file is working on the assumption that pin 1 for gimbal, pin 2 for marker, pin 3 for torpedo, pin 4 for gripper. Meaning pin 1 and 4 are pwm style, while pin 2 and 3 are relay style.

To upload the parameter file to the Pixhawk 6C, run:

```bash
mavproxy.py
param load <absolute_path_to_pix6c.parm>
```

## Running SITL

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/ardupilot ardupilot-dev sim_vehicle.py -v ArduSub --out udp:<your_ip>:14550
```

> Note: after following the above setup to build SITL, this is *the only command* you need to run everytime to start SITL.

`--out` flag is used to specify the IP address and port to send the MAVLink messages to. If you are running your pixhawk package in WSL2, you need to run `ifconfig` in WSL2 to find out its IP address and use that IP address.
If you are running the package in Docker, you might need to add `-p 14550` flag when running the container, or add the port manually, and use `127.0.0.1` as the IP address.

If you use WSL2 (meaning on Windows), you should clone this package and run docker in WSL2 to make it faster.

To launch pixhawk with SITL, there is no change from how you typically run it:

```bash
roslaunch pixhawk pixhawk.launch
```
